            <p>Welcome to my personal portfolio website! I'm a second-year Mathematical Physics major (+ Computing minor) at the University of Waterloo, with a passion for everything related to physics, mathematics, and computer science. Having experience with both studying and teaching these topics, I can say with confidence theres nothing else I'd rather be immersing myself in for my academic studies and future career.</p>
            <strong>Course Work + Performance</strong>
            <p>So far in my undergrad, I've solidified my foundational knowledge in physics with courses such as Mechanics, Waves/Electricity/Magnetism (along with their respective labs), as well as Modern Physics (finished with 99%), Quantum Physics, and Computational Physics. I have an extensive mathematical background, with Calculus 1-4, Linear Algebra 1-2, Differential Equations, Probability, and more. A few of these courses carried usage of Python as well, giving me a familiarity with modules such as Numpy, Matplotlib, Scipy, Sympy, and more. Finally, I have persisted an 80%+ average every term thus far, giving me an academic standing of Excellent.</p>
            <strong>Skillset</strong>
            <p>My extensive skillset has been diversified through my academics, work experience, and extracurriculars.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Languages: HTML + CSS, Javascript, Python, R, MATLAB, Swift</li>
                <li>Technical: Accurate typing speed of 100+ wpm, fluent with the entire Microsoft Office suite, Microsoft Azure, Azure AI certification</li>
                <li>Laboratory: Experience with technical instruments (oscilloscopes, digital multimeters), lab techniques (weighing by difference, chromatography, titration, recrystallization), WHMIS 2015 certified</li>
            </ul>
            <strong>Interests</strong>
            <p>I like to keep my brain sharp by taking on CS challenges such as Leetcode or Project Euler, as well as completing projects in Python (more info in “projects” section). I also have a deep interest for music theory, and enjoy both playing and composing pieces for the piano in my spare time.</p>
