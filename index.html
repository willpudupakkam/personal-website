                <p>Welcome to my personal portfolio website! My name is William Pudupakkam, and I'm a second-year Mathematical Physics major at the University of Waterloo.</p>
                <p>Back when I was a little kid, I remember telling my parents, “when I grow up, I want to be a race car”. To my past-self's disappointment, this ambitious dream did not pan out. However, I went with the next best thing: pursuing my newfound passion for mathematics, physics, and computer science! I started becoming deeply interested in mathematics around high school, and taking physics in grades 11 & 12 instantly hooked me. This ultimately led me to major in Mathematical Physics as well as minor in Computing for my undergrad, a choice which I have not regretted since.</p>
                <p>So far, I've solidified my foundational knowledge in physics with courses such as Mechanics, Waves/Electricity/Magnetism (along with their respective labs), as well as Modern Physics, Quantum Physics, and Computational Physics. I have an extensive mathematical background, with Calculus 1-4, Linear Algebra 1-2, Differential Equations, and Probability. A few of these courses carried usage of Python as well, giving me a familiarity with modules such as Numpy, Matplotlib, Scipy, Sympy, and more.</p>
                <p>My general interest in computer science has also led me to pick up a multitude of new skills. For example, the development of this website is a product of my HTML, CSS and Javascript knowledge (side note: this website was made entirely from scratch; no templates). I’ve also had my eye on iOS development, leading me to pick up Apple’s Swift language. Other languages I know include Python, R, and MATLAB, which have had their uses both among my academic course load and for personal projects.</p>
                <p>Outside my studies I enjoy playing piano to relax. I have a deep interest in music theory, and in fact am working on a project using Python that generates unique musical melodies that sound “nice” (see the projects section below for more info).</p>
